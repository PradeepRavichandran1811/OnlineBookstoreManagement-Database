# OnlineBookstoreManagement-Database
    Hello !!
     Online Bookstore Management System is a Database project that keeps track of Customers, Books, Employees, Publishers, Sellers and Warehouses.
     I have used MySQL to create tables and records. 
     The GUI of the project is done using PHP.
     
     The ‘GUI’ folder has all the files that are needed to run GUI. It can be hosted using either Windows or Linux. I used XAMPP Server in Windows to host Apache server and MySQL.
     “index.php” is the main file which has the GUI. 
     Type the location of that file in browser to view the GUI.
